Fork is a SuperCollider framework for algorithmically composes music to chess games in real time in a way that meaningfully conveys the progress of the game in a musically coherent manner.
Fork is intended to serve as a dynamic, immersive soundtrack to app-based chess where the players have direct control over the resulting generation, thus turning chess itself into a musical endeavor alongside its normal gameplay. The principles behind Fork straddle the boundary between more traditional note structures and compositional use of uniquely electronic parameters such as timbre and spatialization in musically effective sonification of data.
